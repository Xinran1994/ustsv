1. Two ways to create thread
mThread.java, runnableThread.java

2. Explain what is volatile
Java volatile variables are variables that are always read directly from main memory. When a new value is assigned to a volatile variable the value is always written immediately to main memory. 

3. Name examples of Nonblocking data structure, and blocking data structure
non-blocking : Volatile variables, AtomicLong variable, 
blocking:      lock, synchronized block

4. Implement a threadpool
threadPool.java, Task.java, Main.java
or ThreadPool2, poolThread2

5. What is CAS
Compare and swap is a technique used when designing concurrent algorithms. Basically, compare and swap compares an expected value to the concrete value of a variable, and if the concrete value of the variable is equals to the expected value, swaps the value of the variable for a new variable. 

6. --- Write a program, with two threads running a counter. 
twoThread.java

7. Get familiar with Garbage collection.

8. Review sample code for counting semaphore, volatile, read-write-lock, threadpool, singleton.
